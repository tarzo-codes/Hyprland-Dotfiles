# 🚧 Hyprland Dotfiles (Work in Progress)

Welcome to my personal **Hyprland dotfiles** setup — built for a clean, modular, and terminal-focused Arch Linux experience using **Hyprland** as the Wayland compositor.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This setup is a **Work in Progress**. Configs will change frequently, some features may break, and structure is still being finalized.

---

## ✨ Features (Planned & In Progress)

- 🧩 Modular config structure (`hypr`, `waybar`, `rofi`, `swaylock`, etc.)
- 🧼 Minimalist and clean design with sensible defaults
- 🖼️ Wallpaper support using `swww`
- 🧠 Smart keybindings and productivity tools
- 🧪 Tiling window manager behavior using Hyprland
- 🧰 Full support for terminal-based workflows
- 🔄 Sync-ready with Git for easy portability
